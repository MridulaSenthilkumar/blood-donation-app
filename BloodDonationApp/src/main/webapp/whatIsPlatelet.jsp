            <h2>About Platelets</h2>
            <p>Platelets help stop bleeding and can help people with cancer.</p>
            <p>Our amazing donors help meet the increasing demand for platelets to help people undergoing cancer treatment.</p>
            <p>Platelets last just 7 days after they’ve been donated, so we rely on people to donate regularly throughout the year.</p>
            <p>As well as a growing hospital demand for platelets, we also need new donors to replace those who can no longer give.</p>

            <h3>Who Platelets Help</h3>
            <p>Most donations help people who are undergoing cancer treatment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>69% of donations go to people with cancer</li>
                <li>17% helps people who’ve had surgery</li>
                <li>8% helps people with medical conditions</li>
                <li>5% goes to adults in intensive care</li>
                <li>1% helps babies through intensive treatment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Are Platelets?</h3>
            <p>Platelets are tiny gold-coloured cells in your blood which help it clot and stop bleeding.</p>
            <p>Platelet transfusions can help people with cancer and people who’ve lost a lot of blood after an accident, organ transplant, or surgery.</p>
            <p>One donation can help up to 3 adults or 12 children.</p>

            <h3>Could You Donate?</h3>
            <p>Right now there is a need for new platelet donors.</p>
            <p>We need more donors to step forward and donate platelets to help people with cancer.</p>

            <p>Mark has been a donor for more than 10 years. "My grandad and my dad both had prostate cancer and needed platelet transfusions. So I decided to keep donating."</p>
