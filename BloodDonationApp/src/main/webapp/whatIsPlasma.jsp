            <h2>What is Plasma?</h2>
            <p>Plasma is the yellowish liquid component of blood that remains after red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets have been removed. It makes up about 55% of total blood volume and contains water, salts, enzymes, antibodies, and other proteins.</p>
            
            <h3>Role of Plasma</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transport:</strong> Plasma transports nutrients, hormones, and proteins to the parts of the body that need it.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> It helps maintain blood pressure and volume, and regulates body temperature.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Plasma contains proteins that help to clot blood and fight infections.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Plasma Donation</h3>
            <p>Plasma donation is similar to blood donation but focuses on extracting only the plasma component. It is used to treat patients with conditions such as hemophilia, liver disease, and certain types of cancer. Plasma can be donated more frequently than whole blood, making it a valuable resource in medical treatments.</p>
